## **Problem Statement**

The task is to implement a proof-of-concept app called **“Cool Kids Network”**, which involves the following features:

- **User Registration and Character Creation**: Users can sign up, and upon registration, a random character is automatically generated and linked to the user.
- **Role-based Access**: Users with different roles (Cool Kid, Cooler Kid, Coolest Kid) have different levels of access to other users' character data.
  - **Cool Kids**: Can only see their own character.
  - **Cooler Kids**: Can view other users' names and countries (excluding email and role).
  - **Coolest Kids**: Can view all user data, including email and role.
- **Role Management**: Admin can assign special roles to users through a protected API endpoint.

## **Technical Specification**

### **System Overview**

The system is a **Laravel-based backend** with **JWT authentication** and a **React-based frontend**. The Laravel backend is responsible for handling user registration, login, and role management, while the React frontend provides the user interface for the users to interact with the application.

1. **User Registration**:

   - The registration process is straightforward, where users provide their email, and a random character is generated for them.
   - This random character information is fetched from the **randomuser.me API** and consists of the user's name, country, and a default role (Cool Kid).

2. **Authentication and JWT**:

   - We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, which makes the system stateless and scalable.
   - The backend verifies user credentials and returns a JWT token upon successful login.
   - JWT tokens are included in requests for protected routes.

3. **Role-based Access Control**:

   - The user roles (Cool Kid, Cooler Kid, Coolest Kid) determine what data the user can access.
   - The roles are set during registration by default but can be updated by an admin through a protected API endpoint.

4. **Protected API**:
   - A role-based API structure is used to protect sensitive user data.
   - The role of the user determines the level of access they have to data:
     - **Cool Kid**: Can only access their own character’s information.
     - **Cooler Kid**: Can view other users' names and countries, excluding email and role.
     - **Coolest Kid**: Has full access to all users’ information, including email and role.

### **Technical Decisions Made and Why**

1. **Laravel for the Backend**:

   - Laravel provides a robust and feature-rich backend framework for handling authentication, database operations, and API routes, which made it an ideal choice for this project.
   - Laravel also offers built-in support for JWT authentication via the **`tymon/jwt-auth`** package, which simplifies the authentication process.

2. **JWT for Authentication**:

   - **JWT** is the preferred method for token-based authentication, especially when working with a frontend framework like React. It’s stateless, meaning there’s no need for server-side sessions, which is ideal for APIs.
   - JWT also simplifies authentication in a decoupled frontend-backend architecture, where the token is stored on the frontend and sent with each request to access protected resources.

3. **Role-based Access Control**:

   - Using roles helps ensure the correct permissions are granted to different users.
   - Middleware was implemented to enforce role-based access, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain data.

4. **Random Character Generation**:

   - The **randomuser.me API** was used to generate random user data for the character. It’s a simple and effective way to create a fake identity for testing purposes, and it eliminates the need to manually create multiple sample users.

5. **Admin Role Management**:
   - The admin can assign roles to users through a protected endpoint, which is secured by JWT authentication. This allows flexible management of user roles without manual database updates.

## **How the Solution Achieves the Admin’s Desired Outcome**

- **User Registration (User Story 1)**:

  - Upon registration, users provide their email, and a random character is generated for them. This is handled by calling the **randomuser.me API** to generate the user’s name, country, and a default role ("Cool Kid"). The user’s data is then saved to the database, and a JWT is generated and returned.

- **User Login (User Story 2)**:

  - The login process involves checking the provided email against the database. If the email exists, the user is logged in, and a JWT token is returned for subsequent requests. JWTs are used for stateless authentication, and only authenticated users can access their character data.

- **Access to Other Users’ Data (User Stories 3 & 4)**:

  - For **Cooler Kids** and **Coolest Kids**, role-based access is implemented using middleware. Users with the **Cooler Kid** role can see other users' names and countries, while **Coolest Kids** can see all data, including email and role.
  - For **Cool Kids**, they are restricted to seeing only their own character data.

- **Role Management (User Story 5)**:
  - An admin can assign roles to users via a protected API endpoint. This endpoint ensures that only users with the correct permissions (admin) can modify user roles. The roles are limited to "Cool Kid", "Cooler Kid", and "Coolest Kid".

## **Approach and Reasoning**

1. **Modular Architecture**:

   - The application was designed with a clear separation between the frontend and backend. Laravel handles all backend logic, including authentication and role management, while React is responsible for the user interface.
   - This modular approach makes the system easy to maintain and scale, as the frontend and backend can evolve independently.

2. **Role-based Access Control**:

   - The decision to implement role-based access control is crucial for ensuring that users with different privileges can only see the data they are authorized to view.
   - This method provides a clean and efficient way to manage permissions and extend the system in the future (e.g., adding more roles).

3. **Why JWT**:

   - JWT was chosen for its stateless nature, which simplifies the handling of authentication across the backend and frontend.
   - JWT also allows for easy integration with other services in case the system needs to be extended, such as integrating third-party services for user roles or authentication.

4. **Why Laravel**:
   - Laravel was selected for its out-of-the-box features such as authentication, routing, and database handling, which allowed us to focus more on the core functionality without reinventing the wheel.
   - Laravel's built-in support for JWT authentication via the **`tymon/jwt-auth`** package was a key factor in simplifying the implementation.

## **Conclusion**

This solution successfully implements a user management system for the **Cool Kids Network** with role-based access and JWT authentication. The design follows modern best practices in API development, focusing on scalability, security, and flexibility. By utilizing Laravel for the backend and JWT for authentication, the system can easily support future extensions and modifications.
